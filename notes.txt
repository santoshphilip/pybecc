The program is called "pybecc" :-)

It can do the following things
- reads the XML file
- show the structure of the XML file
   - what are the elements in the tree and their hierarchy 
   - can view it at different levels of depth 
   - can view specific objects and the nodes below them
- View the XML file 
   - a more human readable view of the xml file
- Find - DONE
   - Can find objects using a filter (by name, name-starts_with, type etc.)
- Replace - DONE
   - replace fields in a list/group of objects
- Find and Replace - DONE
   - The above two functions together makes it a find & replace

Not yet implemented
- create nodes
- insert nodes
- copy and paste
- sending data from a spreadsheet to an xml file
